# "Good" Man Calculator
This exercise exists to generate awareness about the sheer volume of negative male behaviour, especially towards women. This tool aims to collect data about men in society, and to spread awareness of any inapropriate behaviour towards others. 
The goal is to both educate on the felt experiences of others, and to provide a way to identify men in your life who may be worth ending social relations with.

## How it works
The tool is quite simple, and can also be done on paper.
1. Count the number of men in your life, categorizing them by their relationship to you. (Family, friends, etc.)
   
3. Now remove the men who have exhibited problematic behavior in some way; sexist, transphobic, racist, and so on.
   * Note that extreme examples are not the only terms for disqualification; general harrasement of women, uncomfortable statements or political views may be used at your personal disgression.
     
4. With the "problematic" men removed, think critically about who the remaining men are, how many you started with, and how many are now left over.

## Project Plan
### Create an interactive survey tool
We want users to be able to use our tool to quickly complete the exercise outlined above for themselves--allowing users to identify men in their lives as problematic or non-problematic.
#### Our tool should be able to...
1. To create a list of men, flagging some as problematic.
2. To divide this list into categories based on familiarity. (Family, friends, acquaintances, etc.)
3. To categorize problematic behaviour, based on severity and type of behaviour.
### Create a dashboard for viewing stats
We want users to be able see various stats. For example, stats like what percentage of men become problematic the more you know them. For example, the percent of problematic men as friends versus close friends, family, etc.
The goal is to spread awareness of felt experiences of men on a large scale.
