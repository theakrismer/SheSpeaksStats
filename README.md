# "Good" Man Calculator
This exercise exists to generate awareness about the sheer volume of negative male behaviour, especially towards women. This tool aims to collect data about men in society, and to spread awareness of this inapropriate behaviour towards others. 
The goal is to both educate on the felt experiences of others, and to provide a way to identify men in your life who may be worth ending social relations with.

## How it works
The tool is quite simple, and can also be done on paper.
1. Count the number of men in your life, categorizing them by their relationship to you. (Family, friends, etc.)
   
3. Now remove the men who have exhibited problematic behavior in some way; sexist, transphobic, racist, and so on.
   * Note that extreme examples are not the only terms for disqualification; general harrasement of women, uncomfortable statements or political views may be used at your personal disgression.
     
4. With the "problematic" men removed, think critically about who the remaining men are, how many you started with, and how many are now left over.
