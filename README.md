# "Good" Man Calculator
This exercise exists to generate awareness about the sheer volume of negative male behavior, especially towards women. This tool aims to collect data about men in society and to spread awareness of any inappropriate behavior towards others.
The goal is to educate others on the felt experiences of others and to provide a way to identify men in your life who may be worth ending social relations with.

## How it works
The tool is quite simple and can also be done on paper.
1. Count the number of men in your life, categorizing them by their relationship to you. (family, friends, etc.)
   
3. Now remove the men who have exhibited problematic behavior in some way—sexist, transphobic, racist, and so on.
   * Note that extreme examples are not the only terms for disqualification; general harassment of women, uncomfortable statements, or political views may be used at your personal discretion.
     
4. With the "problematic" men removed, think critically about who the remaining men are, how many you started with, and how many are now left over.

## Project Plan
### Create an interactive survey tool.
We want users to be able to use our tool to quickly complete the exercise outlined above for themselves, allowing them to identify men in their lives as problematic or non-problematic.
#### Our tool should be able to...
1. To create a list of men, flagging some as problematic
2. To divide this list into categories based on familiarity. (family, friends, acquaintances, etc.)
3. To categorize problematic behavior based on severity and type of behavior.
### Create a dashboard for viewing statistics.
We want users to be able to see various stats. For example, statistics like the percentage of problematic behavior versus familiarity The greater the familiarity, how does the percentage of problematic men change?
The goal is to spread awareness of the felt experiences of men on a large scale.
